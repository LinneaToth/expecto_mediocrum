# 🪄 Expecto Mediocrum
> *"Flick to summon... Something?"*

**Expecto Mediocrum** is a browser-based magical experiment, procured during a lunch break in December, that lowers the bar for wizardry. Using your webcam and a cloud of 5,000 golden particles, it attempts to procedurally generate majestic spirit animals. 

Sometimes it looks like a Stag. Sometimes it looks like a glowing potato. That's the magic. Wee!
